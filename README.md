# Pineapple


cross platform, (maybe)

useing mariadb connector right now because that is what arch has by default.
for now, this will only work with maria becuse the is the best open src opion i have.

I need to fix up a lot of the structure. but i have an idea of how this will work

you will need some dependinces for this to work.
will make more comprehensive later
this use mariadb because that is in the standered arch repo
this is also only tested on linux.
idk if it actually works on windows or mac



to build run the build_vendor first. then build_pineapple. the .sh of build_pineapple can take ninja as arg

exe is in build/bin/
