# Pineapple

currently use build.py to make build files.
--vs2022 (windows default)
--gmake (linux/mac default)
--ninja

run.py should be used after calling the respective commads for ninja, make, and vs
in build folder

the ninja.sh is for my use. others scrips can be made depending on combination
