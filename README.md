# Pineapple


back to cross platform, (maybe)

You will need some other dependences for nanodbc. go to their github to see what is needed.
will add information here later

may have to deal with open gl, too

this is also only tested on linux.


to build run the build_vendor first. then build_pineapple. the .sh of build_pineapple can take ninja as arg

exe is in build/bin/
