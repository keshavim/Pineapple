# Pineapple

You will need some other dependences for nanodbc. Ill list them later

this is also only tested on linux. 

currently use build.py to make build files.
--vs2022 (windows default)
--gmake (linux/mac default)
--ninja

run.py should be used after calling the respective commads for ninja, make, and vs
in build folder

the ninja.sh is for my use. others scrips can be made depending on combination
